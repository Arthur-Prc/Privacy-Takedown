- Takedown Request 
Template: 
To: [Website Admin or Domain Provider]
I am writing to request the removal of infringing 
content from your website. The infringing content is 
located at the following URL: [URL of infringing 
content].
The infringing content is [description of infringing 
content]. This content infringes my 
copyright/trademark/other intellectual property 
rights.
I am the [copyright owner/trademark owner/other 
intellectual property rights holder]. I have attached a 
copy of my [copyright registration/trademark 
registration/other intellectual property rights 
registration] as proof of ownership.
I demand that you remove the infringing content 
immediately. If you do not remove the infringing 
content within 10 days, I will take legal action.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]

- What to do later?
● If there’s no response for 7 days you 
may re-submit the request.
● In case the website admin or company 
denies the removal, you should improve 
your arguments based on the US 
copyright and GDPR laws.
● Don’t re-submit more than two times, 
excessive requests would result in legal 
fees because of the reviewing costs 
from their end.
● If you are not sure if the content has ‘fair 
usage’, contact privacytakedown.com 
services for support.
